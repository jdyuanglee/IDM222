			<h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
			<p>This is Yuang Li, an international student from China majoring in Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University. I was born in Suzhou in 1998 then my family moved to Shenzhen when I was 6. Shenzhen locates on the southeastern of China and links to Hongkong. I lived there for 12 years and took all my education there.
			Studying abroad is a very important decision for me and my family. We made the decision when I was senior in middle school.</p>
			<p>
			I took 3-year's high school in the international department sponsored by a public high school. I have been through both Chinese high school's education (courses like Math, Physics, Chinese Literacy, etc.) and United States' high school's education. (courses like Natural Science, Social Science, Humanity, etc.) 
			I also have tried and accomplished some my personal interests and activities in my life. I enjoy doing the pencil sketching, playing saxophone and attend many different kinds of activities related. I joined our high school's TV station and did video editing via Vegas Pro there. I always enjoy sports and try to be better. I found our high school American Football club and joined a team in the city playing against other football lovers. I practiced and learned some of my skills like photoshopping, choosing BGM, via those advertising activities.</p>
